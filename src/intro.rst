Introduction
============

When one learns to program, frequently a course is taken, or a book is
purchased.  Generally, these books take one through various programming
concepts and require the student to do certain exercises to illustrate a
point.  Unfortunatelly, most of the exercises have the little if anything to
do with real-life progamming.

The goal of this course is to teach programming in Python.  However, instead
of writing little nonsense programs, we will create a full-featured program.
We will build this program piece-by-piece, focusing on programming principles,
computer architecture, software engineering, and collaboration.  At the end of
the course, we will have a complete product that will be released under an
open-source license.  The resulting program will be a reflection of what one
puts into it.


The Idea
+=======

The program that we will create will be a file transfer application.  Some
features will be:

* Transfers encrypted via SSL
* Resumables transferes
* Create sharing links
* Multi-file upload
* Web INterface
* REST API
* Download tracking
* "Listner" client that performs automatic downloads
