===================
Lesson One - Tools
===================

Programmers, just like blacksmiths, need certain tools to ply their trade.

Tool 1 - Compiler / Interpreter
=============================

We will be building our application using the Python_ programming language.  Python is an interpreted language.

Tool 2 - Text Editor
====================

We will be using the PyCharm EAP IDE.  While it is more than just a text editor, its text editor provides useful
features such as syntax highlighting and code folding.

Download the PyCharm EAP by visiting the `EAP Download Page`_

Other text editors available are:

- Vim_
- Notepad++_
